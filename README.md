# JSON parser implementations
This repository is a collection of JSON parser implementations in various
languages. They are absolutely not production ready; I am just fooling around
with languages that I find interesting.

All implementations should roughly follow this interface:

```
type JsonNode =
    | String
    | Number
    | Null
    | Boolean
    | Map<String, JsonNode>
    | Array<JsonNode>

type JsonParser =
    fun parse(data: String) -> JsonNode
```

## Languages

| Name   | Test command     | Review                                                                                                         | 
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C      | `make tests`     | Better than expected. Lacking in type safety but the preprocessor & union types make up for some of it. 6/10 |
| Golang | `go test`        | Programming in Go honestly feels like a worse C. The type system is so weak that I get angry. No true enums, no unions, no generics, shitty structural typing, `nil` pointers, `interface {}` for polymorphism, the ability to instantiate incomplete structs... the list goes on and on. 2/10 |
| Rust   | `cargo test`     | Absolutely fantastic. Great ecosystem with low barrier of entry. Strong type system. Built-in testing framework. Generics, traits & algebraic data types makes working in Rust a breeze. 9/10 |
|Â OCaml  | `dune runtest`   | Good FP language with a strong type system. The docs & ecosystem are quite lacking though. Setting up a test case took several hours. 7/10 |
| Pascal | `make tests` | An oldie but a goldie. Pascal has a very strong & flexible type system for its age. However, the language is quite unergonomic to work with due to its verbosity and bad error messages in the FPC compiler. 5/10 |
| Zig    | `zig test parser.zig` | Working in Zig is like C but with better type safety. Very innovative generics and compile-time execution in general. Sometimes the language feels unnecessarily low level, especially in regards to pointers and the bombardment of "const" everywhere. The documentation is bad (as expected) and the error messages are somewhat cryptic. 7/10 |
